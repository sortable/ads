Basic Prebid Example
====================

This example takes the [basic prebid example](http://prebid.org/dev-docs/examples/basic-example.html) and extends it to work with the Sortable ad manager.

In this example two HB frameworks are configured with the ad manager - Prebid and Sortable. This example provides an A/B test between the two frameworks. Only one framework is randomly selected and used on the page at a time. However, it's also possible to enable both frameworks and have bids compete at the highest price.
