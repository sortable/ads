Basic Prebid Example
====================

This example takes the [basic prebid example](http://prebid.org/dev-docs/examples/basic-example.html) and extends it to work with the sortable ad manager.

In this example two HB frameworks are configured with the ad manager (Prebid and Sortable's). In this example, only one framework is randomly selected and used on the page at a time, providing an A/B test between the two frameworks. However its also possible to enable both frameworks and have bids compete at the highest price.
